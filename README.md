### !!! SNAKE LIKE GAME !!!
Ill never forget my first cell phone and its only functioning game, Snake. 
This familiar game slithered its way into the heart of many of us. Known to be frustrating and addictive. Its a game that stands the test of time
Its a game that truly stands the test of time

## Tech to be used!
*** HTML YAY!
CSS AWESOME!
JAVASCRIPT COOL! ***

## !!! MVP GOALS !!!
Have a game board with borders
player controls a block that grows when coliding with food blocks
Player can see total blocks theyve consumed on screen as a score keeping method
If player colides with self game displays a "you lose" text
When the snake eats a block food another one is spawned in a seemingly random place
If player colides with borders game displays "you lose text"
Snake continues to move as soon as game starts and player is only able to control direction
The "Enemy ai" is the placement of blocks

## !!! Stretch GOALS !!!
Snake moves faster with each sprite consumed as a difficulty measure
Add music on a loop that speeds up as player plays to increase chaos
Sounds for when player eats a sprite or loses game
Snake can win by collecting all the consumables and filling the game board
uploading custom sprites



## !! ROADBLOCKS OHHH NOOO !!
Time organization! over the holidays I will be spending many days taking a long drive to see family across the country. Though I will have time for some note taking through my trip.
I have already ran into trouble thinking of a way to make my snake sprites change direction with player movement and would love to have the eyes do this.
